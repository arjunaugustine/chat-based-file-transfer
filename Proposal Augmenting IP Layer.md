#Just an idea I'm (Danis) working on. We can chuck it if you guys don't like it
1. Introduction
When the internet first started, it was meant to cater to a specific and limited set of applications. But with the advent of time, we have reached a point in time when the internet caters to almost 

2. Problem Statement
The current layer 3 (IP Layer) of the internet contains only the very basic data tags. This was done for the sake of KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid). But in the modern day, there are many applications which can do so much more with some changes to the IP layer. Adding metadata tags to improve the functionality of the IP layer to suit specific applications. 

3. Project Objectives
The project objective is to augment the IP layer (Layer 3) of the internet so that we add Internet of Things functionality augmenting information like location coordinates indicating where the data is collected from, adding time stamp information etc. This will enable us to develop a real time view of the internet of thing system without resorting to external dependencies that utilise a seperate stream of service like GPS services. Certain literature sources refer to a network of this kind as a Location Aware network.
